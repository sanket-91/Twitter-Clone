# Twitter-Clone

A small front-end Twitter-like UI project. This repository contains static HTML and CSS for a Twitter clone layout.

## What you get
- `index.html` — main page
- `input.css`, `output.css` — styles (input is the source for your CSS)
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — project metadata

## How to run
You can open `index.html` directly in your browser. For a simple local server (recommended) run one of these from the project root:

PowerShell (built-in Python):
```powershell
python -m http.server 3000
# then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

Or if you prefer Node.js and have `http-server` installed:
```powershell
npx http-server -p 3000
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

## Contribute
Feel free to open issues or pull requests. If you want a README expanded with screenshots, tech stack, or contribution guidelines, I can add them.

## License
Add a license file if you'd like this project to be open-source (e.g., MIT). I can add one for you.
